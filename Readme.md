boom 0.0.1 is a crash manager. I wanted one, to be used with several of my apps and I also wanted to assay racket GUI capability. This is a first attempt. This proof of concept works. But fitting content into UI containers turned out to be trickier than expected. At the moment backend is more satisfying than front-end.

boom will be a customizable third-party application, which desktop applications will be able to run before crashing, so as to inform users, display error reports, eventually send these to a bug tracker (though contacting remote bug trackers is not implemented yet) and restart calling application. 

# Compilation command
Compilation was tested in ubuntu. Type: raco exe --gui --orig-exe boom.rkt

#Pass an error report

Error reports are passed as json files. boom can be called without any command line arguments. In this case, the error report should be created in its executable directory and the file should be named crash.json. When no such file is found and no command line argument is provided, the main window displays a message informing about this. Also restarting the calling application is disabled, since boom does not know which one it is.

## Error report structure

Any other key but those provided hereunder are ignored.

#Customizing boom

Only the most basic configuration parameters have been implemented so far. Some more will be added. A default configuration is hard-coded. But it can be overridden in 3 ways, so as to customize boom. A per caller app configuration can be achieved by editing its configuration file. A per bug configuration can be obtained by toggling options in its command-line or bug report file. In the end, some options can be enabled/disabled by toggling associated fields in UI. Precedence order is summarized in the following (where '>' means 'overrides'):

user choices > bug report > command line > config file > default

# todos

- contact remote bug tracker
- add corporate icon
- rework UI
- turn config file parameters into lists, so as to manage app-specific profiles
- making boom able to be contacted by remote crashing computers
